Hi! I'm a 5th year Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. **Khena Swallow** in the [Attention, Memory, & Perception lab](https://amp-lab.psych.cornell.edu/). 

My research examines whether structures embedded within everyday experience (e.g., **event boundaries**) influence *how* we dynamically source information and allocate attention over time, and consequently *why* we remember certain parts of experience better than others.  

Prior to grad school, I was a research assistant in the [Sleep and cognition lab](https://sleepcognition-lab.org/) at NUS, working closely with Dr. [Stijn Massar](https://sites.google.com/view/stijnmassar/home) on projects investigating the monetary influence on cognitive effort allocation. 

I earned my B.S. from Melbourne University where I worked with Drs. [Stefan Bode](https://dlab.unimelb.edu.au/), Carsten Murawski and [Daniel Bennett](https://bennett-daniel.github.io/) on how monetary feedback modulates belief updating correlates.
