# Wellcome to PYSCH1140 (Fall'21 & Spring'22)
*This page is still continuously being updated.*

Welcome to the landing page for PSYCH1140 - Event Cognition: How people remember and experience events. I developed and delivered this course during the Fall'21 and Spring'22 semesters as part of [Cornell's First Year Writing Seminar](https://knight.as.cornell.edu/fws-guidelines) series. Here you can find: 

- the course [syllabus](/assets/psych1140/syllabus),
- the course [schedule](/assets/psych1140/schedule),
- a collection of class worksheets, homeworks, and assignments. 

## A little bit about me

I'm currently a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in Cornell Psychology Department. Through this course, you'll see a little glimpse into my research interests and teaching philosophy.

## To my students 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver this course, I learned so much from all of you. For being so graceously understanding of my shortcomings as a new instructor, for laughing along with me at my brain farts in class, and most important of all, for doing your best in the midst of the pandemic, thank you. You're truly champions and I'm so proud of you. 

You can always contact me at <ss3837@cornell.edu>. Some reasons you may want to contact me: 
- To say hi and give me some life updates
- To ask for letter of recommendations 
- To ask about grad school applications, my experience during Ph.D., or research more broadly 
- To ask questions when you're not sure who to ask (I may not have the answer, but I may know people who do!)
